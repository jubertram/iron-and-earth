      "title": "Motivation strategy (part 1)",
      "date": "23 may 2006",
      "content": "Regularly, the judgments and analyzes that we make about others or ourselves, identify what seems to be a fundamental gap, an apparent failure of the will of the individual: the lack of motivation. The desire to change oneself, or to help others to change, by learning new knowledge or techniques, comes up against resistance. Teachers are sometimes disappointed to see their students stagnate when they feel they are giving their best. Athletes wishing to improve their performance can only see the failure of their efforts to progress. Parents worry about seeing their child lose interest in school. In many areas (sports, professional, sentimental…), we often notice, and bitterly, our own lack of motivation to accomplish a task. What generates this lack of motivation? Can we consider that unmotivated people are naturally unfit? Does the other (or myself), the one who fails, have the “failure gene” in him? In order to better understand what concerns us, it would be wiser to speak of a lack of method rather than a lack of motivation. Because, as we will see, the method creates the motivation. Those who act successfully have worked out, consciously or not, an effective method. We must indeed establish a strategy for any attempt to improve in an area of ​​our existence that is important to us. But how to establish an effective strategy? How to “hold on”, stay motivated in the face of difficulties, boredom? What makes a teaching quickly bear fruit or fail, struggling to advance students? The purpose of the following text is to deepen our reflection through the examination of a particular case: the desire to improve one's athletic abilities through bodybuilding.",

      "content": "Fighting Entropy. Our first article sought to highlight the relationship between motivation and method. It emerged from our analysis that the creation of an effective method required taking as its foundation the will to overcome resistance to change by developing a feeling of control. The notion of method is different from that of strategy. The two terms should not be confused. After having defined them, we will, by examining the concept of entropy, propose a reflection on the concept of “individual strategy”. This reflection cannot be deep enough without understanding the previously elucidated notions of homeostasis, resistance to change and sense of control. In order to perceive the major issues of such a reflection, it may be useful to reread, beforehand, the previous article (Brief analysis of the relationship between motivation and method). Let's start by defining method and strategy in order to know how to differentiate them. Method: logically ordered set of principles, rules, steps to achieve a result.",

      "title": "Thinking about conflicts",
      "date": "3 January 2010",
      "content": "As a wish for this new year, I decided to share with my readers some quotes from Françoise Kourilsky (Doctor in Psychology, graduate of Sciences-Po). January 2010 can be a starting point for undertaking different relationships with others, for renewing our vision of the world and of otherness. All these quotations are numbers from the book “From Desire to the Pleasure of Change” published by Dunod. Conflicts result from human rigidities. Conflicts are the basis of the evolution of living systems. It is our way of approaching them that makes them threatening or fruitful, a source of blockage, destruction or evolution. The resolution of conflicts, in what it requires reflection, choice and overcoming, invites us to pass to a higher logical level where their useful function of evolution can be identified. While conflicts most often result from power struggles, they are also linked to dissatisfaction, frustration, devaluation, or boredom. Faced with unsatisfying work, or unrewarding routine relationships, resorting to conflict can bring some excitement. It is therefore a question of whether we want to change things or punish the other by making him lose. It is therefore a question of whether we want to change things or punish the other by making him lose. Individuals in conflict are indeed made up of real robots, 'trivial machines': their behavior becomes so predictable and their options so limited that it becomes possible to anticipate their stories to tell them, in a provocative way, how they must function. Conflicts are maintained by our repetitive behaviors that imprison us in vicious circles. Many conflicts are perpetuated by the very fact that we no longer use what characterizes our human dimension, namely the autonomy where precisely our creativity resides.",

      "date": "18 january 2012",
      "content": "Freud speaks of “repetition compulsion”, Levine speaks of “reenactment”, Watzlawick speaks of “always more of the same thing”. We could also cite Karli, Lipton, Selye, Rossi, etc., all of whom have approached this subject in their own way. It is our tendency to want to repeat a situation (where we have been put in difficulty) as often as possible, hoping, in the end, to win. It is an unconscious process, which is based on deep animal roots. Knowledge makes it possible to seek other paths. Not to know it is to kneel down, to humiliate oneself while thinking of fighting: constantly returning to a confrontation in which one has been defeated, hoping to win the case in the end. All this by overbidding each time, telling ourselves that if the strategy has failed so far, it's because we haven't done enough. Incapable of telling oneself that, if one has failed, it is only because the strategy is bad. But those who are caught in this gear cannot, because their limited horizon (lack of critical perspective) only allows them this strategy. It is therefore a snake that bites its tail harder and harder... It is the fly that constantly bumps against the window, while a slight lateral flight of a few cm would allow it to envisage the exit, where the window is slightly open. The image is therefore that of an infernal circle from which we must get out, and this is done by being creative, open, by reflecting on our conditioning. My in-depth articles on the blog are intended to provide elements to overcome these situations. Because getting out of an infernal circle means being able to progress in general, and not just in bodybuilding. This will thus avoid monomania (obsessive bodybuilding type) and doping (which is the saving tool of those who stumble against a wall, repeatedly, thinking that it is physiological, when it is much more than That). This will avoid repeated injuries, compulsive hate attacks that enslave the one you hate and stifle creativity. When a problem arises in bodybuilding, the mistake is to seek its solution only in the specific field of bodybuilding.",

      "title": "Day One Introspection",
      "date": "1 January 2013",
      "content": "Wanting to play a game without knowing the rules seems absurd, doesn't it? Yet, from a relational perspective, this is what we almost all do, almost all the time. When two people are in a relationship, if the two do not know the rules of the relationship, it will often be a source of conflict and frustration. When two people are in a relationship and only one knows the rules, there is a possibility for the one who knows them to manipulate and influence the relationship (for good or bad). The rules of the game can lead to cooperation or competition. To construction, maintenance or destruction. This is valid for the relationship with your body (during bodybuilding since that is what interests us here).",

      "content": "What do I see through the keyhole? My own look. “When we react to someone's words and actions, we are not just reacting to those words and actions. We also react (and even more) to the idea that we have of the situation. Between our perception and our reaction, there are our representations, therefore our education and our beliefs. Even before our perceptions, there are our representations. Representations (and therefore subjectivity) direct our perceptions and our reactions. We react a little to each other, a lot to ourselves.” Around the age of two, the child is able to say “I”, and therefore to distinguish himself from the world and to tell his story. He then enters the world of representations of the world. As he grows up, he will paradoxically think that he can be objective', 'that he sees the world 'as it is' since he feels separated (like an observer who would see the 'real' world unfold, from a keyhole, while he himself would remain motionless and unchanged). What he “sees” are in fact his representations.",

      "title": "What is the ecology of relationships?",
      "date": "21 june 2021",
      "content": "(couple, family, work) Being ecological means respecting the rules of an ecosystem. The individual is an ecosystem. The childhood of this individual is an ecosystem. That is to say, it is a set of elements in dynamic interaction, which self-regulate, to form a stable whole. You may not think about it, but without rules of organization and adaptation specific to the human species, we could not become a singular human individual: a stable form that is identifiable. We would be either anything, changing shape all the time, or… nothing. This whole that the individual is at a moment of his life (childhood) is therefore subject to determinisms that impose operating rules. And it'll stick with him all his life, no matter what he thinks about it; no matter what he knows. Ecology is the knowledge of the operating rules of a self-regulated whole, subject to environmental disturbances. And this is also what we do to respect this whole. If we are not ecological, the ecosystem becomes fragile, declines, is permanently damaged, or even: dies. If we are not ecological, we can destroy a child, an individual, a couple, a family, a nation, a species... A planet! In short, a “good” life, a successful life, is not possible without knowledge, respect and production of human ecology. A step towards an ecology of childhood (the book) makes it possible to produce this ecology, based on what founds the human ecosystem (its nature). It also allows us to reconstruct this ecology, when it was not respected when we were children. We also learn that the ecology of the child is part of more global ecologies (individual, species, society). We thus learn to think of the child inscribed in his family, itself from the couple, inscribed in society, inscribed in the rules of the living (those of the species, like those managing the relationships of the living at the planetary level ). Thus, Towards an Ecology of Childhood not only teaches us the rules for building a healthy child but also sheds light on the healthy functioning of the family and the couple. And allows you to have a “meta” point of view on relationships in general. Stop stumbling against the glass, like the fly, which longs to finally regain freedom. Because the window is open, a few centimeters from you.",
